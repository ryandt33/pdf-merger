# PDF Merger

This is a very simple program.

It reads all pdfs in the folder /pdf/ and passes them through a merger with a file in the _root_ directory called "merge.pdf".

It ouputs a merged file (with the same name as the original) to the output folder.

## Installation

1. Clone into the git repo.
2. Run npm -i
3. Create a pdf and output folder
4. Add a merge.pdf to root
5. Put your pdfs in the pdf folder
